# Matrix Text Simulation

Welcome to the Matrix Text Simulation repository! This project is a C# console application that mimics the iconic digital rain effect seen in The Matrix film series. The application creates a visual spectacle in your console, with glyphs raining down the screen in a manner reminiscent of the film's famous visual effect.

[Files will be uploaded in the future. This README is writen before hand.]

## Overview

The Matrix Text Simulation is designed to run in a console window, utilizing C# and the .NET framework to create a dynamic and visually appealing simulation of the Matrix's digital rain. This project serves as both a fun homage to the film and a practical exercise in C# programming, involving concepts like multi-threading, console graphics, and character manipulation.

## Features

- **Digital Rain Effect**: Creates a captivating display of Matrix-like glyphs flowing down the console screen.
- **Customizable Glyphs**: Allows for easy customization of the characters used in the digital rain, enabling you to create various visual styles.
- **Variable Speeds**: Each column of glyphs falls at a random speed, enhancing the simulation's dynamic and unpredictable nature.
- **Color Variation**: Implements color variations to more closely resemble the green-tinted digital rain seen in The Matrix.
- **Resizable Console Window**: Adapts to the size of the console window, ensuring that the digital rain effect fills the entire screen area.

## Getting Started

To run the Matrix Text Simulation, you'll need to have the .NET SDK installed on your computer. After cloning this repository, navigate to the project's directory in your terminal or command prompt. You can build and run the application using the dotnet CLI:

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Alternatively, if you're using Visual Studio, you can open the `.csproj` file and run the application directly within the IDE.

You can also run the compiled .exe under bin\Debug.

## Customization

The application's source code includes variables that control aspects of the digital rain, such as the glyphs used, their color, and the speed of their descent. Feel free to modify these variables to customize the simulation to your liking.
